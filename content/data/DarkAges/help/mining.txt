Greetings adventurer!

Mining is one of the most important skills in the gamemode.
You can make better axes, pickaxes and swords by improving mining.
Actually, mining is just one of the two skills which is needed to improve.
The other one is smithing but about that we talk later.
First of all you have to find a mine.
In the mine you have to find an ore. By pressing left click
with a pickaxe you start to mine the rock.
Next to this text you can see a list about the rocks.
On level 1 you can only mine stone but usually there is a quest
which requires stone and you get enough xp to jump 2 level.
Good luck.
