Greetings adventurer!

There are many ways to restore your hunger.
The best way to do it is fishing.
You can fish near to fishing spots.
Fishing spots are in the water. Bubbles show its place.
By using any fishing swep, for example fishing rod you
can gather one fish. You can cook it and eat it.
The other way is to plant fruits like banana or apple.
You can buy seeds in the garden shop.
With planting seeds you improve your farming and with
cooking them you improve your cooking.
You can eat some of the fruits themselves.
You can make more complex meals which restore more hunger
by using more resources.
Next to this text you can find the list of eatable meals
and cookable resources.
Never forget your hunger!
