Greetings adventurer!

In this gamemode you have to survive and improve.
There are many things you can do and have to do in Dark Ages.
First of all you have to eat and drink.
Thirst and hunger can be found in the right bottom of the screen.
You can drink by standing in the water and press E [Use button].
Eating is a bit more complex.
First of all you have to use your axe [F1] -> stone axe -> Equip.
After you equiped it, you have to find a birch tree [white tree].
Press left click with the axe on the tree to chop it out.
After you have 2 birch you have to find a crafting desk.
Press E on it and make a fishing rod.
After that, find a fishing spot and press left click with the fishing rod.
I reccomend you to look for it next to the river on the map called Valos.
After this, in your inventory press on the birch log and make a campfire.
Press E on the campfire and cook the fish. You can eat it now.
