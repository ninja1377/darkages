Greetings adventurer!

Runecrafting is a really important skill for magic.
Without runes you can't use magic.
You need level 3 mining to mine rune essence.
After you gathered some you have to find the rune altair.
There is a picture about it next to the text.
Rune essence isn't enough to make runes, you need an orb.
The orbs' element sets the runes' element.
You can get orbs in dungeons.
You can get more information about runes in the Runes menu.

Have fun with magic.
