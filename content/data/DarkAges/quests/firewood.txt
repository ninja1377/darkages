You, you're looking like a lumberjack! The city
has run out of firewood. The furnaces need
to keep running! Our lumberjacks are ill and
I have to keep them alive. So we
need you to cut down some trees and
bring us 40 birches. GET TO WORK!
When you're not fast the whole
city will freeze to death next winter...
