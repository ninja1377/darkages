Thank God! Help has arrived!
We've been stuck down here for ages!
Wait..you are here to help us right?
Good. In the room to your right is Marcus.
He's been poisoned by one of those..things.
The only way he can get better is by extracting
some venom from one of the zombies and trying
to find the antidote. Please, get some venom!
If you don't, Marcus won't make it. Bring it
to me when you have it, I knows what to do.
