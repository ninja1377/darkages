Hello there, and welcome to the Valos apothecary.
We operate from donations, would you be so kind?
We accept money, but I think a fierce adventurer
like yourself needs gold too. I have an idea.
What if you get me, say, 8 potions? That way, one or
more people will be saved, and you get to keep
all of your money! Do it for the weak, please?
