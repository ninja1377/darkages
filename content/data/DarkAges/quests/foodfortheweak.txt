Hello there, and welcome to the Valos apothecary.
We operate from donations, would you be so kind?
We accept money, but I think a fierce adventurer
like yourself needs gold too. I have an idea.
What if you get me some food? That way, one or
more people will no longer be hungry, and you get
to keep all of your money! Do it for the hungry, please?
