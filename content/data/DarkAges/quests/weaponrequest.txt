You, adventurer, there's a request from the king!
The armory needs weapons for our soldiers and
scouts. He needs 5 bronze scimitars, 3 iron
2H swords and 2 steel longswords. Bring them to
me or we're not able to defend the city.
Do it for me, the king and most important of all..
for the country! You'll earn great rewards and
be respected by the soldiers.
