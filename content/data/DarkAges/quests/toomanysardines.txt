Hey, I'm the fisherman and i have a
problem. There are too many sardines in the
lakes. I need help or they'll kill the
other fishes. If we catch 80 of them,
they wont be able to get more children.
Hmm... I'll catch 40 and you'll catch 40
thats fair, isn't it? And look at your
rewards they're pretty good.
