Welcome to the world of Dark Ages.
You're about to accept your first quest.
You have probably already noticed the basic needs of your character in the
top right corner.
Make sure you never get hungry or thirsty, as this will cause you to slowly
die,
allowing other players to steal your stuff!
Now, let's get started. The options menu can be opened using F1,
you can make fires and plant seeds using F2 and F3 opens your quest log.
Your skills can also be seen in the options menu, and you can choose to 
track certain skills,
making their statistics show on the HUD. This makes it a lot easier when you
want to achieve a certain level.
The options menu includes your inventory aswell, so you will need this menu 
frequently.
your english is perfect
For this tutorial quest, you will need to get some logs, stone and trout. 
Once you accepted this quest,
press F1 and go to your inventory. Grab out your pickaxe,
or whatever you want to start with. To gather a resource from a tree or ore,
simply equip the tool and press mouse1 on the ore or tree. Your character will
now gather an ore or a log,
the ores gathered depend on what you're mining, but the logs are random.
To fish, equip your rod and find a good place, where the land is almost the
same height as the water.
Fishing is as easy as mining or anything else,
simply press mouse1 on the water and your character will begin to fish.
Now that you know the basics, why not try them out?
Bring me 2 stone, 2 oak logs and 2 trout, and I will reward you with 
experience and some tin ore.
